# MyGo app maintenance

Check the app's pinned MyGo version and existing conventions before changing APIs. Locate its source with `go list -m -f '{{.Dir}}' github.com/egoist/mygo`; read `ui/doc.go` and relevant implementation comments rather than assuming the latest API.

The native UI rules below apply where the app uses package `ui`; preserve a web app's frontend and typed Go/TypeScript bindings.

## UI lifetime and identity

- `ui.Context` and `ui.Element` are temporary build-pass objects. Keep them out of app state and background work; a single frame can rebuild several times. Store semantic keys, widget state and pending focus requests instead.
- For lists, tables and outlines, prefer `ListState.Focused(c)`, `FocusWithin(c)`, `Focus(c)` and `Shortcut(c, mods, key)` when available in the pinned version. Query inside row builders or after building the list; hidden lists report absence. Clear a pending focus request only when `Focus(c)` returns true.
- With older versions, reset optional element references every build and query only after construction. Hidden, empty, loading, error and alternate views must leave absent references nil. `ui.List` builds rows before returning its element; use a current-pass parent scope for row focus styling, never a previous list pointer.
- Preserve identity when siblings change: give containers stable, unique `.Key(...)` values immediately after creation, before building children. Widgets that process input during construction cannot be keyed directly; key their surrounding container. Use stable item keys in `ListState.Key`.
- A non-nil pointer can refer to cleared or reused storage. Check lifetime ownership before adding nil guards or panic recovery; nil-analysis tools do not establish frame validity.

## State, work, and rendering

- Views may rebuild several times for one event. Trigger external side effects through handled actions or explicit guarded jobs, not unconditional rendering code.
- Keep slow I/O and expensive computation off the UI thread. Publish results through `Window.Update`; it is asynchronous. `Invalidate` requests redraws without synchronizing model writes. Cancel obsolete jobs or reject stale results after source changes or window closure.
- Keep drawing callbacks limited to painting; they can run repeatedly. Prefer MyGo widgets/base widgets to preserve keyboard, focus, disabled, and accessibility behavior. Follow the app's theme and sizing conventions.

## Verification

- Reproduce UI failures with `ui.NewTester`. Exercise extra frames while elements disappear and return, plus relevant focus, typing, and shortcut behavior.
- Run targeted regression tests, then `go test ./...`. Use race checks when changing shared state, and inspect rendered output or the native app when changing layout/platform behavior.
- For upgrades, verify affected API/lifecycle assumptions against the new pinned source and rerun relevant UI tests. Report remaining platform-specific verification limits.
