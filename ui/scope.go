// moves it among the dialog's elements alone, it moves into the dialog as
// the dialog opens, unless something in it took it, and the window's
// shortcuts built outside it wait while it shows, as what is behind it is
// inert, which assistive technology does not see either. The elements of
// a popover (PopoverBase) follow its anchor in the focus order. Escape
// closes the overlay on top, unless the focused element takes it, and an
// overlay closing with the focus in it gives the focus back to the element
// that had it as it opened.

// with that backdrop (0 for none), in the popover of that anchor (0 for
