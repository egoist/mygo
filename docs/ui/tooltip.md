# Tooltip

`Tooltip` shows a tip once the pointer rests on an element, and describes
the element to assistive technology:

```go
ui.Button(c, "").Label("Share").Tooltip("Share with others").Children(func() {
	ui.Icon(c, share)
})
```

The tip shows once the pointer has rested on the element for 0.6 seconds,
below and to the right of it, kept in the window, and goes as the pointer
leaves. A press or a click on the element closes it until the pointer
leaves and comes back: it does not show again after a click, nor beside
the menu a menu button opens. Over elements inside one another, the
innermost one's tip shows. Give one to buttons showing only an icon, and to
what a label alone does not explain.

The tip takes the theme's `Inverse` and `InverseText` colors, its text and
background turned over unless the theme sets them (see
[themes](styling.md#themes)).

## Accessibility

Assistive technology reads the tip as the element's description, after its
name, as help text, unless `Description` gives another.
