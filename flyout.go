	// menu bar app: it goes next to the icon, on the side Placement
	// names (PlacementBottom below an icon of the macOS menu bar, which
	// flips above one of a taskbar at the bottom of the screen), and
	// floats above the windows of other apps. Anchor does not apply.
	// Linux's tray icons tell neither clicks nor where they are: a menu
	// item of the icon opens it there, in the middle of the primary
	// display's work area.
	Tray *Tray
	// Anchor is the rectangle the flyout is placed against, in DIPs
	// relative to the parent's content area: the box of the element
	// that opens it, as ui.Element.Bounds gives it, or a point (a
	// rectangle of zero size), such as the pointer's.
	Anchor Rectangle
	// Placement is where the flyout goes from Anchor (default
	// PlacementBottomStart). Where the display's work area has no room
	// for it there, the flyout flips to the other side of the anchor, or
	// to its other end, if that has room, then slides back into the work
	// area, then shrinks to fit it.
	Placement Placement
	// Gap is the distance between Anchor and the flyout, in DIPs.
	Gap int
	// Width and Height of the flyout in DIPs (default 200x200).
	Width, Height int
	// Focusable makes the flyout take the keyboard as it shows, and close
	// as a menu does when the user presses outside it, another window
	// takes the keyboard or the app is deactivated: OnClose listeners
	// hear it, and may keep it open, except on Wayland, whose compositor
	// dismisses it. On Linux and Windows the press only closes it, as it
	// closes their menus; on macOS it goes on to what is under the
	// pointer. Menus, lists to choose from and popovers are focusable,
	// and handle their own keys.
	//
	// Without it, the flyout never takes the keyboard, which stays in
	// the parent, and stays until it is closed: tooltips, hover cards,
	// or the suggestions of a text field in the parent, which closes
	// them as it sees fit, as when it loses the keyboard.
	//
	// Either closes, as the user closing it, on an Escape its content
	// does not handle: no element or shortcut of native UI takes it, no
	// handler of the page calls preventDefault.
	Focusable bool
	// Hidden creates the flyout without showing it.
	Hidden bool
	// Shadow gives the flyout the system's window shadow (macOS,
	// Windows). On macOS it follows the shape of what the content draws,
	// and outlines it with a hairline: the content draws no border there.
	// On Windows 11 the system rounds the flyout's corners as it rounds
	// its menus, and outlines it: the content draws neither a border nor
	// rounded corners there.
	Shadow bool
	// Popover gives the flyout the look of the system's popovers on macOS:
	// it shows in an NSPopover, which draws its material, rounded corners,
	// shadow and an arrow pointing at the middle of Anchor, and animates
	// as it opens and closes. AppKit places it on the side Placement
	// names, or the opposite one where the screen has no room: the rest
	// of Placement, and Gap, do not apply. As AppKit's popovers do, it has
	// the keyboard while it shows, Focusable or not, which makes it close
	// as the user clicks elsewhere. Its content draws no background there
	// (ui.Context.Vibrancy reports the material): elsewhere, where Popover
	// changes nothing, it draws its own.
	Popover bool

	// URL is loaded right after the flyout is created, as
	// WindowOptions.URL.
	URL string
	// Page configures the flyout's web page.
	Page PageOptions
	// Content makes the flyout show native UI instead of a web page, as
