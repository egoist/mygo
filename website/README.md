# MyGo website

The home page and, at `/docs`, the guides of [`../docs`](../docs), built with
TanStack Start and shadcn/ui. Every page is prerendered at build time, and
Cloudflare Workers serves the result as static assets, with no Worker code.

```sh
bun install                    # at the root of the repository
bun run --cwd website dev      # http://localhost:3000
bun run --cwd website build    # dist/client
bun run --cwd website preview  # dist/client, served by wrangler as in production
bun run --cwd website deploy   # build, then wrangler deploy
```

Pages of the docs are rendered from the markdown when the site is built:
the order of the sidebar comes from the lists of `docs/README.md`, and links
between pages, such as `bindings.md#events`, become links of the site.
